## Doodlebot
Add this bot to your Telegram group chat and it will keep track of your Doodle polls. 

Once added it will listen for Doodle URL's. If you send the URL of a Doodle in the chat, the bot will remember it.
You can view the current poll by sending `/doodle`. If the poll is still open, the bot will show its participants,
if the poll has been decided, it will show the final date that has been decided.
